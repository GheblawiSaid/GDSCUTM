# GDSCUTM
My comtribution on GDSC UTM:

I joined Google Developers Students Clubs UTM in april 2023, where we managed to make many sorts of programming events inside UTM JB during the time of the semester. I was the lead of multimedia in GDSC.

the event that I want to talk about in this reposotory is the achievement where me and my team succefully finished and made the python event which was called "Python 101: Unleashing the Power 
of Coding with GDSC UTM!" on 1st of june 2023.

Reflection:

Since I'm a programming student, its important to spread the programming knowledge across UTM students from other faculties, and that was our main goal, which is to introduce programming with simple demonstration to other students in UTM. I had fun across the whole 2 hours, we gave snacks, we answered programming questions, we assisted students in their 1 on 1 sessions during the event.
